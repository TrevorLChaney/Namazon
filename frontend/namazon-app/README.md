# Final notes
To run this project you must first install the node dependencies in both the front end and the backend folders with npm install. To run node you must use 

```
node index.js
```

in the backend folder and for react you must use

```
npm start
```

in the frontend end folder where the respective package.json files are located.

This has been difficult for me but I feel like I have leared a lot in this process.
